```

## Release Schedule

Production releases of RbxPI Install Manager are very rare, and major updates are also very rare because RbxPI Install Manager was designed to be sustainable over time without requiring modifications.

Since RbxPI Install Manager relies heavily on HTTPS requests to communicate with the GitHub API, modifying its interface without changing the entire underlying logic is difficult. This is why major updates are both infrequent and challenging.
